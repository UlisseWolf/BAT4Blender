# BAT4Blender

(tested with Blender 3.6)

## Installing the Add-on
The general gist of it is as follows.
1. download the `source` folder.
2. rename the folder to BAT4Blender and zip it (the files inside the zip should end up inside a BAT4Blender subfolder).
3. open Blender and go to `Edit` -> `Preferences` -> `Add-ons` -> `Install..`
4. navigate to the zip file created in step 2.
5. select `Install Add-on from File..`.
6. the Add-on is now installed and available in the `Properties` context menu in the `Scene` tab.

Notes
- in Blender print output is send to system console, not to the python console. Go to 'Window' -> 'Toggle System Console' to open it.
